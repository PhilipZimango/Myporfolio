                    In my free time, I enjoy a diverse range of activities that keep me both mentally and physically active. I find joy in driving, exploring new routes and destinations. My passion for entrepreneurship often leads me to brainstorm new ideas and strategies, even outside of work hours. Additionally, I am an avid reader, constantly seeking knowledge and inspiration from books. I also love hiking, which allows me to connect with nature and stay fit.
